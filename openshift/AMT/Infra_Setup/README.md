# Structure

This repository is composed of several folders, each dedicated to a specific topic:

#  - Infra_Setup

    This repository stores the scripts and info related with the AMT infrastructure setup. The purpose is to document the steps to setup the MeshCentral solution used as the base of AMT.

    The documentation only describes the steps to setup and configure MongoDB and MeshCentral in each host. The Azure host provisioning isn't part of this process.

    For more information about the deployment process and/or setup problems, contact @Christian Lyngsmo / @Mervyn Roman.
